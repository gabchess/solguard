# SolGuard — 60-Second Demo Script

## 0-10s: THE HOOK
**[Show dashboard with tokens auto-scanning]**

"Every day, thousands of new tokens launch on Solana. 98% of them are scams. SolGuard catches them before you lose money."

## 10-25s: LIVE AUTO-SCANNING
**[Point to the auto-scanning feed, new tokens appearing]**

"SolGuard monitors new token launches in real time. No manual input needed. It pulls from DexScreener, analyzes onchain data through RugCheck, and scores every token automatically."

**[Click on a RED token — show risk breakdown]**

"This token scored 29 out of 100 — RED. Concentrated holders, no liquidity locked, danger flags everywhere. SolGuard caught it instantly."

## 25-40s: SERIAL RUGGER DETECTION
**[Scroll to Serial Rugger Leaderboard]**

"But SolGuard goes deeper. It tracks deployer wallets across multiple tokens. If someone deployed three rug pulls before, their next token starts with a penalty."

**[Click into a deployer profile page]**

"This deployer launched 4 tokens — all scored RED. That's a serial rugger. SolGuard flags every future token from this wallet."

## 40-55s: THE SCORING ENGINE
**[Show risk breakdown bars]**

"Our scoring engine weighs five factors: deployer history, liquidity locks, token authority, holder concentration, and age. For pump.fun tokens, we zero out authority weight because it's always auto-revoked — a signal that fools other scanners."

"Kill switches force RED status when extreme signals are detected, regardless of the composite score."

## 55-60s: THE CLOSE
**[Zoom out to full dashboard]**

"Other tools investigate after you lose money. SolGuard warns you before. It's autonomous, real-time, and built on Solana."
