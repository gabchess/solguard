# SolGuard Demo Video Script (75 seconds)

## Scene 1: Hook (0-8s)
"98.6% of tokens launched on pump.fun are rug pulls. Thousands of people lose money every single day. What if you could see the danger before you buy?"

## Scene 2: Intro (8-15s)
"Meet SolGuard. Autonomous, pre-emptive scam detection for Solana. It monitors pump.fun in real-time, scores every new token's rug pull risk, and warns you before it's too late."

## Scene 3: Dashboard (15-30s)
"Here's the live dashboard. Every token gets a risk score from 0 to 100, powered by a 5-factor analysis engine. Deployer history, liquidity status, mint authority, holder concentration, and token age. Green means safer. Yellow means caution. Red means stay away."

## Scene 4: Search (30-40s)
"Paste any Solana token address to get an instant risk breakdown. See exactly why a token scored the way it did, with links to official Solana documentation so you can learn while you stay safe."

## Scene 5: Serial Rugger (40-55s)
"But here's what no other tool does. Click on any deployer address to see their full history. If they've launched scam tokens before, SolGuard flags them as a Serial Rugger. You'll see every token they ever deployed, their average risk score, and a clear warning badge."

## Scene 6: How It Works (55-65s)
"The pipeline is simple. Monitor pump.fun via WebSocket. Analyze with our 5-factor scoring engine. Alert through the dashboard and X posts. Investigate deployer profiles to trace patterns."

## Scene 7: Close (65-75s)
"zachxbt investigates after scams happen. samczsun responds during exploits. SolGuard warns before users get rugged. Built for the Colosseum Solana Agent Hackathon 2026."
